‘Why do you have scars on your arms? Did you try to kill
yourself?’ people ask me from time to time. Many people don’t
understand why inmates harm themselves while in prison and
what the meaning of it is.

In the prison etiquette there is a concept ‘the last resort’.
This includes hunger strike and self-harm. According to the
informal prison rules, the last resort is applied in three cases:
danger to life, danger to health and danger to personal dignity.
The logic of such actions is simple: by putting his life in danger
an inmate forces the administration to hospitalise him and thus
temporarily avoids staying in a critical situation, since for a
dead con the authorities of prison can lambaste a screw or other
staff: take them to task, de-bonus, sometimes even fire them.

It was danger to health that forced me to use the last resort
in 2015. From the very beginning, things didn’t click with the
administration of Gorky colony No. 9 where I was brought after
the conviction under art.411 and a new one-year sentence. This
was not surprising - they didn’t bring me there to quietly do my
time. Among cons the Gorky colony is considered ‘a jawboning
colony’, where inmates who stand out from the general crowd
(politicals, unruly crime lords, enthusiasts that like to complain
about the incarceration conditions) are jawboned particularly
harshly.

Hardly had I come to the colony, when vexations started: I
went to bed too early (30 minutes before the lights-out), refused
to clean the toilets (meaning that I refused to perform the task
of a ‘petukh’), didn’t greet the staff properly and so on. ‘Ten

days in the de-seg’, this is what I heard from the governor. But I
should say that things didn’t go smoothly in the de-seg either.
I spent my first term with other inmates, and already there was
astonished by the aloofness and cynicism of the administration
in regard to everything that concerns the needs of inmates. I
thought that after four and a half years in prison nothing could
surprise me. It turned out to be not true. For example, after the
first ten days in the de-seg a duty officer took me out not at
the exact time when my punishment was to be over - around
7 pm - but almost three hours later. I spent a long time in the
de-seg in different colonies, and I've never faced anything like
that. The screw didn’t react to my concerns about the fact that
my punishment was over. Thus, I should have gotten to the
section, shaved, washed myself (because I could not do any of
this properly in the de-seg) and made it until the lights-out
scheduled for 10 pm. If I hadn’t made it, I would have received a
ticket in the morning for not being shaven, and generally it’s not
S0 nice to go to bed without washing yourself. So I decided that
cleanliness was more important than the routine and because
I was freshening myself up, I went to bed a bit later than 10
pm. This is what the screws were waiting for and came to the
section five minutes after the lights-out and wrote me up for
‘not following the lights-out command’. And now they had a
violation of the rules, for which you can be sent to the de-seg
again! Such impudence made me angry. Not only had they kept
me in segregation three hours longer than I was supposed to
stay there, but they also stealthily set me up for committing
another violation!

Another unpleasant experience had to do with Gorky’s
medics. According to the law, a doctor was to make his round
in the de-seg twice a day, to make sure everyone feels well. In
the de-seg of colony No. 9 the doctor did the round only once
every day apart from Sunday. On Saturday, staying in the de-
seg, I caught a cold and on the following day started to ask for
a doctor, because it’s not so comfortable to sleep on the plank
floor with a fever and cough. To all my requests the screw had
one reply: ‘The doctor is not here, today is Sunday!” Cons also
confirmed that the doctor doesn’t do the rounds on Sundays.
But I knew it was lies. In every colony on any day of the week
and at any time there is a duty doctor, and only by lousy custom
of this facility he couldn’t be bothered to get out of his office in
the infirmary and walk five hundred metres just to bring some
pills to some con - perhaps, the latter won’t die till tomorrow!
But even all this is an insufficient reason for the last resort.
The reason appeared after I was sent to the de-seg for refusing
to work. That time I was staying alone in a very peculiar cell -
it was situated a metre away from the seat of the guard. This
was done allegedly to control me better. But the main thing
was that it was a corner house situated in the corner of the
barrack. One might wonder, what is the difference? A cell is a
cell everywhere. But a regular visitor to the de-seg knows the
difference very well. The cops know it too. The thing is that
corner cells are the most damp and cold. They are cold even
in summer, let alone winter!. When back then, on May 19, I
was locked in cell 16, I immediately closed the window, hoping
that by the night-time my breath will have brought the room
to a more or less acceptable temperature. But these hopes were
misplaced.

The most difficult night in my life began. After the lights-
out I lay down on the floor and realised it wasn’t plank at all. It
was so cold and rough that I first thought it was concrete. But
having picked it open in one place I realised the floor was made
of chipboard, which is also a law violation, because according to
the regulations, the floor in the de-seg and SHU must be plank.

The first ‘round’ of sleep lasted for about thirty minutes. It
was the longest one as well. Later I wasn’t able to sleep longer
than fifteen minutes, the omnipresent feeling of cold would
not allow it. That night I realised how biting and relentless the
cold can be: taking every grain of warmth one by one from your
body, it forces the mind to think of nothing else other than how
to get warmer. This compulsive idea pulses in your head like a
woodpecker who never finishes his work; it feels like an always
hungry predator whose hunger cannot be sated. Cold, really
cold. The cold is in your arms, legs, back, nose and ears. Trousers
tucked into socks and jacket tucked into trousers don’t help any
longer. Around the middle of the night traditional ‘warm-ups’ -
push-ups and squats - stop helping as well. The body doesn’t
have any free calories in stock to process them into warmth.
On top of that, after a few hundred push-ups and squats there
was no energy to do them any longer. The situation became
desperate. Closer to the morning (this is how it felt, though
I didn’t have a watch) I started experiencing peculiar ‘sleep
hallucinations’: T was dreaming that I was asleep at home
under a wide warm blanket. I feel very good and comfortable,
pleasant and light... A thought pierces my mind: why would I
worry so much, jump, do push-ups and squats, if I sleep so well?
Here my brain gives a command to wake up. I open my eyes
and my whole body is shaking with heavy and painful shivers:
I finally understand where I am and that I need to stand up
again and try to squeeze some active movements from myself
to increase the temperature of the body and sleep for at least a
few more minutes. The atmosphere and general experience was
enhanced by bright electric light of two bulbs hanging from the
ceiling. The lights were left on in the de-seg, and I felt like I was
in some amalgam of madhouse and torture chamber.

Finally, the morning came. I ate and was hoping to sleep in
order to somehow compensate the hours [ wasn’t able to sleep
at night and get back to normal. The guard, of course, wrote
me up for that (and that ticket added several more days to my
segregation), but I didn’t care anymore.

After the morning check round I lay down and realised that
I was naively mistaken: even the daytime temperature in the
cell didn’t allow for normal sleeping. So it turned out that I
couldn’t sleep either during the day, or at night. I remembered
the agonising night and realised that there were at least nine
nights like that ahead and, most probably, even more, because
the governor for sure would add more punishment. Then I
realised that something was to be done.

During the day I was constantly demanding from the
duty associate governor who sometimes came by to the de-
seg to move me to another cell. The arguments were that the
temperature here was lower than should be according to the
law, and the floor was from chipboard, while it should be plank,
and that was another violation. He would listen to my requests
and drop indifferently: “We’ll see... or ‘T’ll clarify...’, but the
situation didn’t change. Meanwhile, I understood that if I spent
nine more nights like this in the de-seg, I would leave it with a
multitude of ills in addition to the ones I had. I needed to leave
by any means necessary. [ prepared a razor blade that I brought
on me to the de-seg despite the shakedown (thanks to the advice
of old-timers) and started to make a plan. Originally it was the
following: just after the evening check round I would cut my
veins on both arms and the stomach. The main things was to
cut properly, not just scratch myself: I had seen a lot of those
who ‘harmed themselves’ by scratching their arms and the cops
just laughed at them - they would bandage you right in the cell
and wouldn’t even ask what you wanted. In order not to freeze
in this house, I had to cut myself seriously, but at the same time
not too much, because if I did, I could freeze forever. I decided
to do the following: first I reach the veins on my arms, scarify
them, pour the blood out into my half-litre mug until it’s full
(a man can survive after losing up to half of their blood, and I
have five litres inside), then I empty it out under the door of the
cell (right after the check round there will be the duty assistant
governor and a guard - they will notice it for sure), and then I
cut open my stomach (two fingers down the belly-button, this is
how I was taught), ideally all the way through to the abdominal
cavity, depends on the pain limit.

For the hundredth time I asked to be moved to another cell
and understood they would not do it and I had to get onto action.

My schemes from the very start were foiled by an unexpected
shift in the check round, as a result of which I decided not to
wait and started to cut myself earlier.

I hid behind the ‘armour’ (a screen between the toilet and
the rest of the house) so that they couldn’t see me through the
peephole, crossed myself, took the razor blade and made the
first cut on my left arm. Was it scary? Of course, it was. But I
understood what I did and why. Contrary to expectations, blood
didn’t come out in fountain, but instead a few drops appeared
and then fused into a tiny trickle - I spilled just a little into the
mug. Then I began to make not simple cuts, but cuts-strokes,
so that the thin blade penetrated as deep as possible. A few
times I had to strike twice in the same cut to make it wider.
Some cuts turned out quite successful: a good half centimetre
deep and a centimetre wide. But there was still too little blood.
Maybe it left the periphery of the body and flew inside from
excitement? They say there is such a biological mechanism of
adaptation to danger... Finally, cops lingered at my house - the
check round! I hid my arms behind my back, came out of the
‘armour’ and stood at attention like an obedient con. Now the
most important thing was that they didn’t notice it - it’s too
early!

‘Good evening’, said the duty assistant governor.

‘Good evening. Dziadok. Everything alright’.

“You sure about that?’ I see distrust in cop’s eyes.

‘Tam’, I smile.

The cop looks around the cell fishily...

‘Why are you not wearing a uniform?” before they entered I
didn’t manage to put on the jacket and was in a t-shirt.

‘T didn’t manage to put in on, you entered so fast!’ I smile
again and think to myself, ‘God, I hope they don’t spot the
drops on the floor!”

Finally, the door closes and I'm laughing inside at how I
made fools of them. Dorks!

But the alertness of the guard let me down. I immediately
went behind the ‘armour’, and the guard, probably instinctively,
sensed that something was wrong and continued looking into
the peephole instead of going to another cell. He obviously
saw either blood, or my arm that showed itself from behind
the ‘armour’. I heard the scream behind the door, ‘He’s cutting
himself!” In a few seconds the cop unlocks the first lock. I realise
that the time is up, take the razor blade in the other hand and
quickly, with all my might cut my right arm. The cop begins to
open the second lock, on the bar. I'm so lucky it is a screw lock!
This gives me a few seconds more, I lower down my trousers
and with the greatest possible pressure strike with the blade
over my stomach. I manage to do that three times before the
cops burst into the cell. I throw the blade into the sink, and it is
quite successful, because it goes into the drain at once.

The duty assistant governor and the guard stand and watch.
Blood is coming down both my arms and stomach. They take
out hand-cuffs and put them on me. They bring me to the
exercise yard, it’s walking time actually. I sit and find myself a
bit shocked... Now the most important thing is that they fulfill
my demands. But I regret that everything went against my plan.
Well, so it goes - it worked out in some way.

Ten minutes pass. I hear the conversation of inmates who
call to one another from different yards:

‘Listen, what’s the fuss? Why are cops bustling?’

‘Dziadok has cut himself!’

‘Who?’

‘Dziadok!’

‘Who’s that?’

‘A political’.

‘Dziadok is here!” I enter the conversation.

‘Why did you cut yourself?’

We fall into talk. I explained to them my general situation in
the colony, listened to their advice...

Finally, a ‘triplet’ comes into my yard: head of the operative
department, head of the security department and head of the
medical wing. The security officer tells me to undress - they
start to search me. They are only interested in one thing: how
did I smuggle the blade? Of course, I don’t tell them that.
They probed everything, including the elastic webbing on my
underpants, looked at my heels (what if I have something stuck
there?) to make sure I don’t have any razor blades and only
after that they asked what the reason of my action was.

I lost patience: very emotionally I told them they really
overdid it with carrying out the KGB orders and voiced my
demands: I need to be moved to any other cell. They listened.
The operative asked everyone to leave and ordered the removal
of the handcuffs. We were left one on one. The door to the yard
closed and he asked me with irritation:

‘What do you want?’ By virtue of his operative nature he
can’t believe that my demands are the ones I’ve just mentioned,
he thinks I have something else in mind.

Such a question confuses me at first.

‘T will not tell you what I want, because you will always do
your best for me not to get this’, was my answer. I didn’t see
a point in asking him for more, anyway, I will not be granted
acceptable incarceration conditions.

I heard wordy unfinished hints from the operative, like:
‘Don’t you understand who you are?’ (meaning they will jawbone
me anyway), ‘There are certain rules of the game...” (I still can’t
understand what he meant by that). He also attempted to
convince me to live according to their rules: the operative said

that even a former crime lord Galey - ‘a respectable man’ - goes
to the industry area to work. I didn’t hear a definitive promise
to move me to another house from him.

Finally they brought me to the doctor. They ripped off the
clothes from my arms and stomach which had almost dried on,
and then started counseling whether they needed to stitch the
cuts or a simple bandage would be enough. They decided to
apply a bandage: then the incident can be qualified as a slight
accident, because if they had stitched me, it would have meant
that the wounds were serious. This was detrimental for the local
administration who, as I later learned, reported this situation
to the top officials - the Minister of Interior.

After the dressing I was brought to the house... The same
house. And there I made another mistake. Instead of refusing
to enter it, I believed the duty assistant governor who said that
the matter of my transfer to another cell ‘was being decided’.
The cell was turned upside down: my entire modest belongings
were ransacked, the rubbish bin was turned over right on the
floor. They were looking for the blade. It was about 7 pm...

Approximately every half an hour I began to bang at the
door and ask why I wasn’t transferred. They palmed me off
with promises to do it ‘very soon’. But when the lights-out time
came, I realised that I had been deceived: they decided to turn
high-minded, like, ‘he is being uncompromising, and we will
not surrender’.

I had a ‘plan B’ for such developments.

In cell 16 before me there was a former crime lord Dima
Galeyev (Galey) who was extradited from Sweden to be put into
a Belarusian prison. The Ministry of Interior wanted something
special from him in their criminal games. As a result, the cell

was stuffed with different things that you can’t usually find
in the de-seg. One of them I noticed from the very beginning:
near the toilet there was a crooked stick of uncertain origin and
purpose (probably for ‘working together’ through the disposal
system between cells). I took a cloth and covered the peephole
in the door so the guard couldn’t see what I'm doing. I took
the stick, pushed it through the grating surrounding the bulb
under the ceiling. With the stick I hoped to crash the bulb, cut
myself with a glass fragment and cut my legs as well - there
are more veins on them and they are more dense. This time
they will transfer me to the infirmary, there is no way around
it! After a few strikes the bulb started swinging (it hung on a
cable), but wouldn’t crash. A strike on the grating, another one,
it clings but still is not smashed! I couldn’t get enough swing on
the stick either, it is limited by a ‘square’ of steel bars through
which I had pushed it. I hear the duty assistant governor shout,
‘He is swinging the “accordion”! Unlock the door!” The officer
and two guards run into the cell and quickly understand what I
am up to. They grab my arms and put me against the wall. I'm
angry at their deception and because my plan didn’t work out
again, I can’t control myself and start shouting at them and
threatening with all deadly retributions. The duty assistant
governor commands, ‘Get the handcuffs!” They try to round
me up. I resist as much as I can. But there are three of them.
They literally tap my hands into the handcuffs: in this tussle
the fresh bandaging came off and I started bleeding again. The
duty assistant governor wants to handcuff me to a metal stool.
There are no sharp objects in the cell, but even if there were, I
realised that being handcuffed I will not reach them, so I have
to promise not to cut myself again.

The cops leave, and I stay in the cell handcuffed. The battle
is lost, but not the war. In half an hour the doctor comes and
applies another bandage. The lights are out, I go to sleep as is;
‘chained’. After some time cops come and take off the ‘bracelets’.

That night I slept really badly again - apart from cold, pain
was torturing me. And I couldn’t really do push-ups with cut
arms. But nature made me a present - right on the following
day the weather got much warmer and the rest of my time in
the de-seg was more or less bearable.

In a few weeks I they had another file on me. Apart from a
preventive record categorised as ‘inclined to hostage taking’ I
became ‘inclined to committing suicide’. Bullshit, if I wanted
to kill myself, I would cut my veins lengthwise, not crosswise.

On the following day there had been a new development:
they locked up the ‘enforcer’ of the pen and his assistant, and
they made a shakedown in the entire barrack of the de-seg and
SHU. They threw away unsophisticated ‘forbidden items’ of
the inmates: pills, magazines, ‘extra’ clothing, threads, cords
and stuff like that, and didn’t forget to remind that this was
happening because ‘the political had cut himself’. In such an
unsophisticated way cops were setting other cons on me.

What is the moral of the fable? The is only one moral: if you
go to the de-seg, bring two razor blades.
