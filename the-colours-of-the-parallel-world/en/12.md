It is summer of 2012. Shklov correctional colony No. 17.In a
solitary cell days alternate each other - I make up their contents
by myself, so that I don’t get bored. Lunch has just finished,
the chow server took away the bowls. There is nothing to do,
no mood for reading or learning, the heat of the afternoon sun
makes me sleepy. I spread my jacket under the small table (so the
light of the lamp isn’t in my eyes), put an Arabic textbook under
my head and prepared to pass through another hour of another
day in my sleep.

Having snuggled comfortably I began to fall asleep, when
suddenly I heard the buzz of the electronic lock and a clang of
metal bars at the end of the corridor. ‘Someone else has been
brought’, I thought. Every day at about 3 p.m. there was a
‘baptism’ (disciplinary commission) happening in the colony —
an event where the governor distributes days you have to stay
in the de-seg or SHU (although this is in months), and where
any deprivations of visits and care packages as punishment are
announced.

...I hear the sound of stomping boots of at least two people.
Yeah, an officer brought a prisoner. 'm wondering where they
are going: to the de-seg or the SHU cell? Suddenly, the corridor
fills with a hoarse, three-pack-a-day voice screaming at the top
of his lungs:

Apple trees and pear trees went into blooming!
River mists began a floating flow!
She came out and went ashore, Katyusha...

Now it’s clear. This is Kolya.

Kolya is a prisoner who’s gone nuts, I think he is in his
fifties, or maybe younger — he looks too unhealthy. People
like him were called ‘spaced-out’ by the convicts. Kolya and
other ‘spaced-outs’ were subjects of local legends: they were
said to walk around the prison without a name badge, to not
shave, to sauce cops off, and to be free to yell everything they
wanted whenever they wanted. During moments of special
aggravations he is locked in a punishment cell - so he doesn’t
go completely raving mad.

Kolya got ten nights. Of course, this time was fun for him,
but obviously not for the other prisoners and cops. Kolya used
to amuse himself by not giving back a bowl to the chow server
after taking meals. One wasn’t allowed to keep them in the de-
seg or the SHU, so they were taken back after each meal. But not
from Kolya. Often after lunch, breakfast or dinner I would hear
a dialogue like this in the corridor:

Supervisor: Have you eaten?

Kolya: I have.

Supervisor: Give me the bowl.

Kolya: F*ck you!

Supervisor: Give me the bowl, f*cking cocksucker!
Kolya: F*ck you!!!

... This was followed by approximately 15 minutes of wrangles,
after which furious supervisor would open the cell, take the bowl
himself and concurrently hit Kolya in his liver.

Prisoners didn’t like Kolya because of his night freak sessions.
At daytime, he used to doze off, and at night he took the chain

used to fasten to his bunk bed to the wall and hit it against
his bed. Hellish noise filled the whole barrack and let neither
prisoners nor supervisors sleep.

Having spent those 10 nights (not for the first time) Kolya
disappeared. Rumour has it, he was taken to the psyche ward at
the 3rd correctional colony in Vitebsk.

 

Human dementation in prison is a rather frequent
phenomenon. Not only because people with ‘limited sanity’ or
intellectually challenged people often get here, but the prison
itself contributes to the development of various kinds of mental
disorders. Here is what Peter Kropotkin wrote about this in his
‘Memoirs of a Revolutionist’:

‘Underneath me was lodged a peasant, whom Serdukdff knew.
He talked to him by means of knocks; and even against my will, often
unconsciously during my work, I followed their conversations. I also
spoke to him. Now, if solitary confinement without any sort of work
is hard for educated men, it is infinitely harder for a peasant who is
accustomed to physical work, and not at all wont to spend years in
reading. Our peasant friend felt quite miserable, and having been
kept for nearly two years in another prison before he was brought
to the fortress, he was already broken down. His crime was that he
had listened to socialists. Soon I began to notice, to my terror, that
from time to time his mind wandered. Gradually his thoughts grew
more and more confused, and we two perceived, step by step, day
by day, evidences that his reason was failing, until his talk became
at last that of a lunatic. Frightful noises and wild cries came next
from the lower story; our neighbor was mad, but was still kept

for several months in the casemate before he was removed to an
asylum, from which he never emerged. To witness the destruction
of a man’s mind, under such conditions, was terrible’.

To witness the consequence of that destruction myself, was
no less terrible.

When I was in the 17th correctional colony, Kuzya - a ‘brat’,
was held in one of the de-seg cells. He was locked there not for
disciplinary reasons, but for protection from other prisoners.
Kuzya’s problem was that he acted weird; particularly, he soiled
himself, and anywhere at all. According to prisoners’ stories, he
became like this as a result of regular beatings in the section.
Kuzya had been beaten for being a ‘brat’ and, most likely, for
being ‘abnormal’ before he began to ‘shit’. And after that they
continued to beat him, but already for the fact that he ‘shitted’,
and it was unbearable to live with him in a barrack. Apart from
the beatings there were also admonitions, and many times he
had been given clean clothes and bed linen, but everything was
in vain. In order to get rid of him, the administration found
a ‘wonderful’ way out: they put Kuzya to protective custody,
which differed from the conditions of a punishment cell only by
the presence of a mattress on the floor. Every few days I heard
the swearing of the orderly who cursed Kuzya as the mattress
was regularly spoiled. They say, when Kuzya’s mother visited
him in prison, she demanded the administration to explain
what they had done to her son...

There was another character in Shklov colony No. 17 (I forgot
his name). He was put in solitary for stealing from other barrack
residents. Cons had beaten him a few times until he asked to be
hidden. Almost every day he flew into rage: he began to shout
some inarticulate sounds out of the cell and loudly swear at
no one and for nothing. This lasted for hours. But one day he
even began to batter the unsophisticated ‘furniture’ in his cell,
and only then cops reacted - right, he could spoil the state-
owned property! - and called for a doctor. The guards tied up
the poor fellow, and the doctor gave him some injection. Then
the sounds gradually waned, and after half an hour he went
completely silent.

Once in a while the punishment section housed several
mentally unstable inmates at once, and then real fun began.
Just imagine: a corridor with 24 cells, wooden doors that let you
hear everything that is happening inside, and concrete walls
creating excellent acoustics. You sit alone in your cell and hear
voices coming from several sides at the same time:

‘Uuugh... uuuugh... aaaarh... aaaarh...’

‘F*ck! Go f*ck yourselves, fags! F*cking faggots!!!”

‘A-a-a-a-a-a!!! A-a-a-a-a-a!!! A-a-a-a-a-a!!l’

... and this lasts for several hours — until crazy comrades
exhaust their energy. Such moments make you doubt whether
you are still in prison or in a mental asylum. It starts to feel like
you gradually go nuts too.

As I have already written, many ‘spaced-outs’ become real
celebrities: problematic cons are moved from colony to colony
and their reputation precedes them. Hockey is one of them — a
convict from Mogilev colony No. 15. He is a stooped man, of
about 40 years old and constantly wearing stubble on his face.
He’s got a 25-year sentence for murder of a KGB agent, as other
cons say. He spent his first 5 years in Grodno prison convicted
for ‘extremely serious crime’, and this is where he apparently
went nuts, or KGB agents beat his head off. No one knows the

details because it is impossible to communicate with Hockey
closely.

One of the most popular gags about Hockey is about a
radio transmitter in his cap. He is sure that cops have installed
a mike in there, that’s why he often could be found walking
around and muttering swears to his cap addressing them to the
police, the government and Lukashenko. Hockey liked to abuse
Belarusians as well (for electing Lukashenko), especially while
watching TV. Although Lukashenko supporters can hardly be
found among the convicts, Hockey was regularly beaten for
abusing Belarusians. By the way, he was a Russian himself.

He liked to invent sophisticated curses and write them down
in a notebook. Hockey had many writing books all full of notes
in microscopic writing. Those who had a chance to look at them
say that these notes are just an incoherent incomprehensible
word salad full of swears.

However, the most inexhaustible source of fun for the cons
was Hockey’s demeanor with the cops. One day he brought
some porridge from the canteen and put it on a newspaper
with a sign: ‘For Mahoney’ (Mahoney is a nickname of an ex-
warden of the correctional colony No. 15, whose last name was
Makhankov). Once, Hockey walked around shouting swears
out loud to ‘Makhanya and Tolkachikha’. He was called in by
the administration: the warden Makhankov and his deputy
Tolkachev. They asked him a question:

‘Who are Makhanya and Tolkachikha?’

‘They are my whores from Moscow!”

With an honest look, Hockey departed to the de-seg.

One day some cadets visited the correctional colony in
Mogilev. Having walked through the ‘central avenue’ they headed
further in order to look around the rest of the prison. One of
the cadets came off and started looking at the surrounding
sections separated with metal bars. To his misfortune, Hockey
was standing in one of the sections. Clutching hold of the bars
he stared at the cadet with his crazy eyes and shouted some
unthinkable curses in his direction:

‘Who the fuck are you looking at?.. Why come here, faggots?..
Fucking scum pig..."”

The cadet considered it would be better to catch up with the
rest...

I don’t know whether he was beaten by the cops at the 15th
pen, but he was regularly put into the de-seg. Anyhow, it did
not affect his behavior in any way.

The most active hotbed of insanity among the convicts
is undoubtedly the prison. The risk group consists of those
sentenced to long-term confinement, both those who are in
solitary and in common cells. Constrained space, constant
conflicts, swearing, heated atmosphere, fear, inability to change
the situation, provocations and bullying by cops, many years of
imprisonment ahead and, as a result, despair — all these factors
contribute greatly to insanity.

There are not enough solitary cells for everyone so the
administration usually sends ‘spaced-outs’ to the de-seg. Once,
when I was sitting in one of those cells late at night (by the
way, they were situated in the basement), I suddenly heard loud
rhythmic strokes and a wild cry in one of the neighboring cells:

‘Peeoople!!! Peeoople!!!”

The strokes did not stop for an hour and were alternated
with shouts: ‘Let me out of here!!!” - until a block warden
came and gave a couple of punches to the brawler. That day
he calmed down, but on the following day everything started
anew... I asked the guys from the neighboring cells about what
had been going on there, but learned nothing apart from ‘one of
the scums had gone nuts’. To say that I felt strong compassion
for this man would be hypocritical. But trying to imagine the
level of fear and despair that made him, sitting in the basement
of prison, hammer at the door and call ‘people’, I was really
horrified. Monotony, hopelessness, oppressive punishment
chambers, mental illness and, perhaps, a long term ahead - this
is a real abyss.

It is worth saying that the insanity of most ‘spaced-outs’
manifests itself only from time to time. There are also moments
of serenity. This was the case for Sanya - named Shrek - another
inhabitant of the prison in Mogilev. This guy was not even 30
years old. As a child, he studied at school for mentally challenged
children. Even if he had parents, in prison they did not help
him in any way. Doing his time for murder, Shrek had not ever
received any support from the outside. As a rule, Shrek was kept
in solitary, because he did not get along with anyone. Usually
his cell was quiet, but from time to time one could hear swears
addressed to the cops on the most trivial pretext. Usually he
displaced his anger onto supervisors who looked in the feeder
during the mealtime. But the worst times started when Shrek
ran out of cigarettes. Since he had no money to buy something
in a shop, he was engaged in begging cops for cigarettes. He used
to be given 5 cigarettes of the worst brand a day. If he didn’t get
them, he began to yell and hit at the door, break furniture in a
cell, smash the washbasin, break the glass in the window frame.
As a demonstration of a ‘protest’ against the greed of the cops,
he refused to go for a walk, cursing them generously.
Cops used to beat Shrek often. Sometimes they did it right
in the cell, sometimes while calling him to the ‘assembly’, but
always without much effect. In moments of particular outrage,
when the noise from his cell completely pissed off the orderlies,
they simply called the doctor who gave him a shot (as the convicts
said - Thorazine), and Shrek calmed down for a day or so.

In the same way as Hockey was a celebrity at the 15th
correctional colony, Ira was in the Mogilev gaol. She was one
of the few women I met in prison, and she was staying in the
next cell to me: [ was in the 18th, she was in the 19th. The level
of insanity she demonstrated was simply horrifying. For 5-6
hours every day - regardless of the time of day, it could be early
morning or late night - a continuous incoherent text came out
of her cell, which was a stream of sick consciousness. I can’t
recapitulate even a small part of it: memory refused to record it.
Let’s just say she started talking about something, for example,
airplanes, or something she saw on TV, or about planets and
galaxies, she uttered several sentences about it, then starting
from the last words of the sentence she raised a new topic — and
this was never-ending. What was most striking to me - she did
not just talk, she screamed, shouted so loudly that the whole
floor could hear her and all other floors could, too, when she
approached the window. She invariably interjected her speech
with threats and foul language addressing it to cops. Exquisite
and pretentious swears poured on the administration when she
was taken out for a walk. Those cops who were smarter just kept
silent, the more flawed ones began to abuse her in response.

Ira actively communicated with the neighboring cells
through the grilled window begging for cigarettes. And it was
a disaster if some rudeness or disrespect was shown to her
from some cell: she climbed onto the windowsill and vilified the
inhabitants of this cell for hours — and the whole prison heard it.

In retaliation to cops for not giving her cigarettes or just for
fun she could stand naked on a daily head count. Or she could
start drumming on radiators in the dead of night essentially
depriving the entire floor of sleep. In that case the doctor would
come and inject her Thorazine.

But those prisoners who had contacted her through mail
said that, judging by quite meaningful and even literary
letters, 39-year-old Ira was quite a decent woman with a higher
education, who had a daughter. As they say, it was in an effort
to provide for her daughter that Ira had engaged into drug
trafficking from Russia, for which she got 12 years of a strict-
regime confinement...

The administration considers the demented people as an
unfortunate misunderstanding. If they are ‘quiet’, that is their
insanity does not violate the regime (there are loads of such
people), then no one will pay attention to them at all. Well, a
man has gone out of his mind - so what? It saves me an effort
of talking about any treatment: there is only Valeria (to treat
all nervous disorders) and Thorazine in the prison medical
pack for calming down the ungovernable. It’s ridiculous to
talk about the prevention of mental disorders in prison. Each
correctional facility has only one psychologist (by the way, it’s
a cop in uniform, which clearly does not contribute to building
a trustful relationship between them and the prisoners). In
correctional colonies where they pay at least some attention to
the work with inmates, even if it is just for show, a psychologist
meets those who just arrived and talks to them. Sometimes
they can organize a visit to the prayer room or a church.
That’s all. According to the regime, a psychologist is obliged
to conduct regular conversations with every convicted person.
But is this really possible if, for example, there are 1,500 people
in the colony? In some penitentiaries I did not see a single
psychologist for the entire time I was there. That is, a person
is listed in the staff, fills in some papers, simulates working,
gets paid for it, but does not really do anything at all. And
then the Department of Corrections reports to the Ministry of
Internal Affairs about the ‘psychological work’ and ‘individual
approach’ to convicts. The Ministry, in its turn, tells tall
tales to international organizations — how qualitatively and
humanely the correctional colony system works in Belarus —
and everyone is happy. But prisons and colonies continue to
grind someone’s brains, producing morally disabled people
by the time of release. The punitive system is built in such
a way as to work with the consequences, not the causes. Did
someone hang himself in the cell? Why find out what led to
this, it is better to take away all the laces, belts and threads
from prisoners, so that nobody could hang themselves even if
they really want to. Someone went totally nuts and they began
thrashing the door accompanying it with wild cries? Injection
of Thorazine — let another shift listen to these cries as long as
they can! And nobody cares what the reason was: if the regime
officials sent back the parcel from relatives, a mother died or
simply desperation led them to inadequacy.

Nobody heals the mentally ill in prison. Psych ward at
notorious Vitebsk correctional colony No. 3 accepts only those
who have completely lost active capacity: either they cannot
work or keeping them in a punishment cell has already become
harmful. As in any institution of the System people are only
concerned with your functionality: do what you are demanded
and do not stand out, no matter whether you are a hundred
times paranoid, schizophrenic or just a fool. I find it difficult
to judge the quality of treatment in the psych ward at 3rd
correctional colony, but I have not seen a single person who
would voluntarily get back there...

 

Autumn 2012. The Shklov correctional colony No. 17. I was
doing my last months in the SHU - ahead is a court hearing
and transfer to the prison in Mogilev. Lunch is over: today it
was noodles boiled to the state of homogeneous mass. Well, it’s
time to sleep. I prepared my usual ‘couch’, closed my eyes and
almost zonked out, when I heard the familiar sounds - a buzz
of the electronic lock and a clang of metal bars at the end of
the corridor. Who is there this time? I almost fell asleep while
they were bringing the prisoner to the guard — and suddenly I
was thrown out of my dreams by a piercing voice, like a raven’s
croaking:

>Apple trees and pear trees went into blooming!
