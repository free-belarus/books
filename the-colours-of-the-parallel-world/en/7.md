Every prison has its own smell.

When you tumble out of a congested meat wagon with
your sacks, the first thing you see are the inquisitive mugs of
the guards. Reflexively, your pores start to absorb the smell of
the prison that is going to become home for you for the next
months or years.

Volodarka! is saturated with anxiety.

Starting from ‘cabinets” to the ‘submarine’, from the
tempo rary detention unit to dungeons, from recreation yard to
the infirmary, from new blocks to ‘the red block’ — its concrete
walls, tiled here and there, are breathing with apprehensive
attitude. Anxiety over your fate, insecurity and frightening
suspense overwhelm.

Where will the screw locate me? To the ‘blatnoy’* house? Or
to the ‘muzhiks’ one? Or, perhaps, to the pressure-house’?

The investigator has come! What’s going to happen? A face-
to-face interrogation? Has a sidekick started to snitch on me?
Or maybe it’s time to familiarise myself with materials of the
case.

The lawyer! Why so early? It was not so long ago he visited
me! Is anything wrong with the relatives?

Custody prison No. 8, aka Zhodino, aka Black stork (the prison
got this romantic nickname, I suppose, from the cops themselves
by analogy with the Russian Black Swan to add more poignancy
and importance) smells of fear. It’s penetrated the foot-worn
stairs, the scrubbed floor, the cells of concrete and metal, the
walls painted beige and the heads of the inmates. For 24 hours a
day this place is absorbing the tumults and anxiety of those who
are trapped in here.

Inmates are beaten up in Zhodino. Block wardens and the
‘reserve’ beat people for refusal to do the splits, for a rude reply
back to the screw. The prison operatives beat for unwillingness
to make a full confession or declaring hunger strikes. Zhodino
is a ‘red’® prison. In the early 2000s here they broke down crime
bosses and all kinds of prison gangsters. Their blood still smells
like fear; it poisons present-day inmates and intoxicates the
screws with permissiveness.

Mogilev gaol, officially Prison No. 4, smells of sleep. The
staff are quiet and even-tempered (though there are always
exceptions), the halls are silent, nobody is hurrying anywhere:
a sleepy and phlegmatic feeling hangs in the air. About an hour
before the lights-out they spread a long carpet in every hallway
of the prison — to damp the steps of the screw. I was not able
to figure it out for myself why this is done: to not disturb the
inmates’ sleep with their steps, or so that the inmates don’t hear
the screw sneaking up to the door and listening in to what the
inmates are talking about in the cell?

The wing is so quiet at night that while laying on a bunk you
can hear the screw make a tea. Hear him boil the electric kettle,
pour the water into the cup, put some sugar, stir it... take a sip...

It’s interesting, because in Mogilev they also beat the cons,
because even there someone is waiting for a new sentence. But
still the atmosphere is completely different. Maybe it’s because
half of the population there are people with a 10-year or more
stretch? They are fed up with being afraid, there is no reason
for anxiety, there is nothing to wait for...

There is a TV show called ‘The Psychic Challenge’. One
day watching the magicians passing with their hands and
mysteriously squinting into the distance, I thought, ‘What if
they could see the vibes of these buildings and places! Then
over any of these buildings — Pishchalauski Castle, a former
mental asylum converted into a Mogilev prison, the prison in
Zhodino — over the places where the evil will of people who
have once done harm to their loved ones meets the evil will of
the state system, synergetically multiplying each other — they
would see a giant, covering half of the sky, a black swirl which is
sucking life out of those who happen to appear under it.
