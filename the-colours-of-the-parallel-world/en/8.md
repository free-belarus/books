>I wrote this short essay after about three months of staying in a solitary cell of SHU in the Shklov colony. The foundation for it became widely-known in the past book ‘Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece’ by Nikolay Kun, which expounds a number of myths from Ancient Greece, though in a rather truncated and sometimes censored way.\
\
Staying in solitary leads to all the energy of a person being directed inwards, as a general rule, at the thinking process. Not being able to discuss their thoughts with anyone, an inmate pours them out on paper. This was my experience, too: considering the lack of intellectual communication or a possibility to share my ideas, I formulated them in some articles or notes killing two birds with one stone: I didn’t let my brain decay and vented the longing for activity.\
\
Of course, this essay is not an in-depth research, it’s just a short analytical sketch, a reflection on what I read. And even though the theme of prison is not directly addressed in it, I decided to include it in this storybook. Some of the thoughts expressed here may be of interest to some readers. And let professional historians forgive me for my somewhat liberal use of mythological material.


# REBELLIONS AGAINST THE DIVINE HIERARCHY IN ANCIENT GREEK MYTHOLOGY

## INTRODUCTION

Ancient Greek mythology, being a religion at the same time,
undoubtedly exercised ideological functions, too — the same as
religion does in any class society: justifying social inequality,
sustaining the existing state order, reinforcing hierarchy in the
minds of people.

A lot has been said and written about how Greek Olympus
mirrors society with its system of class domination. Similar to
worldly governors, gods of the Olympus demand unquestionable
recognition of their superiority, as well as deference and material
sacrifice from the people. In the case of disobedience, the person
will face dreadful scourge. On the Olympus itself, there is no
equality either. There are principal gods and subordinate ones.
On the top of the pyramid resides Zeus.

But, like in the real world, in Greek mythology, there is always
a black sheep, a ‘disruptive element’ who is able to destroy the
eternal order. In our case, it’s either the one who declares that
they are equal to gods and aren’t afraid of them because of
self-righteousness and vanity, or the one who demands social
equality because of their craving for justice. Both of these
things make a horrible blasphemy by contemporary standards.
Any rebellion, be it the uprising of the masses defending their
rights, or a separate undertaking of a lowborn power maniac
with inadequate demands beneath them is to be suppressed,
and the insurgent should be punished. However, the sheer fact

of a presence of such a narrative in Greek mythology attests to
an ineradicable, centuries-long craving for casting off the lack
of freedom and yoke of oppression, as well as whatever divine
halo this yoke is crowned with.

Thus, in Greek mythology, we can easily find events or
characters that reject the supreme authority of gods and their
demigod relatives that usually made worldly governors. Let’s
consider the most distinctive myths around this issue.


## THE SONS OF ALOEUS

Otus and Ethialtes were the sons of Aloeus who, in his turn,
was born by Poseidon and Canace. The two sons were conceited
and were not willing to conform to anyone. From childhood,
they were brave and strong and were noted for their unusual
height. They started their confrontation with gods with
chaining Ares, the god of war and putting him in the dungeon.
Ares languished in the dungeon for thirty long months until he
was released by Hermes.

Growing bold, Otus and Ethialtes began to threaten other
gods:

‘Just let us gain strength and we will pile one upon the other
the Olympus, Pelion, and Ossa, rise up to you and abduct Hera
and Artemis!”

The response to these earnest threats were the arrows
of Apollo that struck the rebels. It should be pointed out
specifically that the sons of Aloeus belonged to the mortals.

Otus and Ethialtes died relatively fast and as we will see
further, compared to other disobedients, they were blessed.

## ARACHNE

Arachne was a Lydian weaver whose works were famous all
around. Once in the thick of vanity, she declared:

‘Let the Pallas Athena herself come and contend with me!
She will not be able to defeat me’.

Athena came to Arachne under the guise of a crooked old
wife, but before punishing the weaver she decided to stay with
disciplinary measures, namely, she advised Arachne to contend
only with mortals and begged Athena faster to forgive her
arrogant words. Arachne didn’t take the old wife’s advice, she
rudely interrupted her and only complained:

‘Why doesn’t Athena come?”

Then the goddess assumed her real appearance. Nymphs
and Lydian women immediately bowed before Athena and
praised her. But Arachne acted differently — she ignored the
goddess without rendering her any honours and just insisted
on the immediate start of the contest. Consider that there were
no judges on it, they were not elected or appointed, though
what could have been done without them in this situation.

Athena wove a canvas, portraying her and Poseidon’s argu-
ment over the ascendancy over Attica. In the corners of the
canvas she depicted gods punishing people for defiance (what
a hint!). Arachne, in her turn, wove on the canvas the scenes
of gods’ life where gods were actually presented as possessed
with human passions (and let’s note, that gods really were like
that) and didn’t show any proper respect to them. It’s reported
that Arachne’s work was highly competitive with Athena’s work
in perfection. So what should the goddess do? To admit her
defeat? Naturally, it was unthinkable. The decision of Athena

was as simple as top-down governance. She hit Arachne with
a shuttle and tore apart the weaver’s canvas. Unable to endure
the shame, Arachne wove a rope, made a noose and hung
herself. However, vindictive Athena found that even such an
outcome was not enough. She took Arachne out of the noose,
animated her and turned into a spider, thus devoting her to
eternal weaving.

The whole myth is just a quintessence of the blatant
injustice based on ‘natural’ inequality. Think about it: Arachne,
by honestly challenging Athena, believed there should be
unified ‘rules of the game’ for gods and people, and that she,
the mortal, could accrue victory if she objectively prevails.
Such a view of life assumes a bigger trust to the counterpart,
an honest game since, as we remember, there were no judges
at the contest. Thus, the act of Athena looks false-hearted and
traitorous which didn’t actually embarrass her in the slightest.
The goddess lucidly showed Arachne and everyone else that
she was not Rousseau or Voltaire and the principle of equality
before the law was unfamiliar to her. But she generally
accepted the sword law. Since using violence in the situation
when her competitiveness didn’t lose, to say the least, Athena
accentuated the inherent, incontestable inequality of gods and
mortals. This myth and its contents seem to assert: ‘Let you
be as wise as Solomon, let the right be on your side, gods will
anyway tread you to pieces just because they are gods’.

## PROMETHEUS

Prometheus is a titan, the son of goddess Themis. He used
to be Zeus’s ally in the battle for power on Olympus but fell

into the cloud-assembler’s disgrace for adherence to the
ideals of humanism. Living on the Olympus in the atmosphere
of constant celebration, with no want for anything, he took
pity on the mortals. Seeing the suffering to which they were
condemned by gods, he stole fire from his friend Hephaestus’s
smithy (the son of Zeus, by the way) and delivered it to the
people. Moreover, after coming down to earth, Prometheus
continued to provide aid to the mortals: he domesticated a
wild bull, harnessed a horse to a cart, taught people how to
craft, read, count, write and build ships, disclosed to them the
force of herbs.

Let’s note that Prometheus didn’t just give people a one-
time instrument that could make their lives easier, but helped
them to harness the forces of nature that at that time were
directly identified with the force of gods. By this, Prometheus
made them much more independent. Was it in Zeus’s cards?
Hardly so. His servants brought Prometheus to the cliff, and
his friend Hephaestus was instructed to chain him to the rock
and empale Prometheus’s chest fastening him to the rock with
a spike. Suffering from remorse but unable to go against his
father’s will, Hephaestus carries all this through.

But there is another aspect that is bothering Zeus and
multiplying his anger and suspicion towards Prometheus.
Prometheus knows the mystery: how and when Zeus is to
be overthrown from the Olympus and lose his power. Zeus,
naturally, intends to extort this secret from Prometheus.

One by one Prometheus is visited by various deities — Oceanus,
the Oceanids, Hermes — who try in every way to persuade him to
submit and share the mystery with Zeus. But Prometheus remains
adamant. With Hermes he is specifically straightforward:

‘I will not give up my grief for the slavish serving to Zeus.
I'd better be chained to this rock than become a faithful
servant of the despot Zeus. There is no execution, no tortures
that he could use to frighten me and get a single word from my
mouth!”

Well, if that isn’t revolutionary, what is?

For this defiance, Zeus throws the cliff where Prometheus
is tied to down to the eternal darkness, where he then spends
centuries. Having raised him again, Zeus prepares a new chal-
lenge for Prometheus’s revolutionary morale. Every day an
eagle flies to the cliff and leaves only after pecking out his liver.

His liver grows back overnight, and the torture repeats in the
morning. Meanwhile, the titans overthrown by Zeus during the
fight for power have been forgiven and are brought back from
the Tartarus to the surface as those who had acknowledged
the authority of the cloud-assembler. In contrast, Prometheus
stays adamant and proudly endures his suffering (it should be
pointed out that the fate of ardent enemies of Zeus turned out
to be more desirable than the lot of the out-of-favour ally...).
His mother Themis and the hero Heracles come to him and all
ask for one thing: to accept the electoral results... ugh, I mean,
to acknowledge Zeus a supreme governor and reveal the Secret
to him. Heracles treated Prometheus in a chivalrous manner:
he killed the eagle who had been tormenting him for so long.
Hermes flew from the Olympus immediately and yet again
promised freedom to Prometheus in exchange for the Secret.
And here something broke down inside the rebel. Prometheus
told Zeus how to avoid the overthrow: the Olympian alpha male
just needed to stay away from the sea goddess Thetis since any
son that is born to her will be more powerful that his father.

Thus Prometheus gained liberty in return of pursuance of
Zeus’s will.

The myth of Prometheus is noteworthy specifically for the
motivation that inspired the hero to commit a crime against
the divine order of governance. This is not the lust or rapture
of valour of Otus and Ethialtes, nor the self-admiration caused
by the extraordinary artistic skills of Arachne. In the case of
Prometheus, the motivation is the living compassion, love
to people, the feeling of justice and the rejection of slavery.
And it doesn’t matter that Prometheus has broken after long
centuries, no longer able to endure the torture. I would double-
down on the fact that being an immortal titan, he possessed
everything. He was treated with affection by the governor
and well-received on the highest levels of power. However, he
sacrificed all this to ease the suffering of people in this world. I
say it straight: Prometheus is the first known humanist.


## THERSITES

The peak of the egalitarian episodes of Greek mythology,
in my opinion, is the episode from Trojan cycles with a warrior
named Thersites in the lead role. This is not about an individual
rebellion anymore, but about an attempt to raise a popular
revolt. But first things first.

Let me remind you of the plot of the Trojan cycle: Paris, the
son of King of Troy, visits a palace of the local king Menalaus
in Laconia and is being received as an honourable guest.
However, he insidiously takes away his wife from the palace,
the beautiful Helen (a natural daughter of Zeus, by the way).
Menelaus can’t tolerate such humiliation and after consulting

his brother Agamemnon, he decides to declare war to Troy to
retaliate on Paris and get his wife back. He was able to engage in
this campaign as headliners with almost the whole pantheon of
contemporary heroes: the Ajax brothers, Odysseus, Achilles and
many others. All of them came from the supreme aristocracy.
They were sons or grandsons of kings, gods, and demigods — let’s
pay attention to this fact, it is extremely important. Apart from
them, the campaign was supported by 100 thousand warriors,
obviously, not aristocrats, but freemen and landlords. The siege
of Troy lasted for 10 years. On the 10th year, the event in question
actually happened.

Agamemnon decided to yet again attack Trojans by the walls
of the town. However, before that, he wished to test his troops
for loyalty. He called a popular assembly of all the warriors
he had and addressed them. He spoke about the hardships of
war, the idleness of the siege and about the fact that the gods
probably desire that the Greeks win. The reaction of warriors
was immediate — like an insurgent sea, they dashed to the
ships, glad of the opportunity to go back home. That figures: a
simple man from Hellenic province hardly ever craved fighting
and dying for the concerns of the heart of the local king.

And here, a well-known to us, Pallas Athena took the stage.
An important point should be made: the myth of Troy is not a
fairy-tale, not a fancy of the author, but rather a confabulated
story because it is based on a true story despite the existence of
fairy-tale characters. So we will look at what happened later in
the chronicle of historical events.

So, having appeared before Odysseus, Pallas Athena told
him to bring the warriors back as soon as possible. Odysseus
didn’t need to be asked twice. The king of Ithaca snatched away

the scepter (the sign of supreme power) from Agamemnon and
began to actively urge the warriors to come back to the assembly,
so actively that the scepter went in a whirl over the backs and
heads of the fugitives.

The author dissembles the fact as to whether there were
victims of this ‘urging’, but I assume that without killing one
of the several warriors Odysseus could hardly stop such a mass
of people. He was successful in it — the warriors returned to the
assembly and calmed down, just Thersites alone didn’t settle
down and started to shout. Thersites, the author informs,
always bravely spoke out against kings (to be fair, Thersites
himself was related to Diomedes, the king of Argos). This time
he pushed back against Agamemnon saying that he had already
captured a lot of trophies and bond-maids, and it’s time for him
to be seated and for them, simple warriors, to go back home. Let
Agamemnon fight against Troy alone! And now let’s remember
that most kings were related to gods and we’ll realise how far
Thersites went, against whom he raised his voice.

Generally, everything in the speech of Thersites was logical
and fair, but from then on really strange things began. Odysseus
comes to Thersites and says:

‘Don’t you dare, you fool, defame kings, don’t you dare to
speak about returning to your home town! If I ever hear again
you, lunatic, defame king Agamemnon, let my head be cut off
from my square shoulders, let them stop calling me the father
of Telemachus, if I don’t grab you, tear your clothes apart, beat
you up and banish you from the popular assembly to the ships,
and you will be crying in pain’.

In support of his words, Odysseus hit Thersites with a scepter
on the back so that the latter’s eyes flowed with tears.

Then, according to the author, everyone laughed loudly and
said looking at Thersites:

‘Odysseus has carried out a lot of gests in the committee and
in battle, but this is the best of his exploits. How he restrained
the wrangler! Now he will not dare to defame the kings favoured
by Zeus anymore’.

Here, I believe, the author sins against the truth a lot, exposing
all Greek warriors as hopeless idiots who don’t have their own
opinion. Consider this: only a few minutes ago the warriors
were dashing to their ships forgetting about the ‘kings favoured
by Zeus’, and just brutal force and the authority of Odysseus
could get them back. And now thousands of warriors, who had
just wished for doing what Thersites suggested, start to laugh
at him though he expressed the aspirations of every and each of
them. Let’s not forget that often historical events in chronicles
and myths are reshaped in order to please the ruling class, and
in our case, to please the kings-noblemen and their relatives
who would naturally be interested in demonising Thersites by
exposing him as a freak, a wrangler who is beaten up just for
fun. It’s more likely that Odysseus’s act was cheered and loudly
praised by people like him: kings, the blue blood of the Greek
army and maybe his confidants from common soldiers. Simple
warriors, I believe, were looking at the scene with sadness, but
they didn’t dare to openly support Thersites. Over nine years of
the siege they got used to obeying to their leaders, moreover, they
understood perfectly well that if there is a rebellion, Odysseus
will be immediately supported by the top militaries. This is why
common soldiers were looking at the humiliation of Thersites
clenching their teeth with anger and fear, and not jovially
laughing. This version is much more probable, in my opinion.

But the story of Thersites doesn’t end there.

From the far-away Pontus, the Amazons came to help out
the Trojans. The battle was boiling yet again, where women
were fighting under the leadership of queen Penthesilea. In the
heat of battle, she was killed by Achilles. Looking at Penthesilea,
Achilles understands that he loves her and bows his head
over the dead in sorrow. Here it would be great if Penthesilea
opened her eyes full of passion and Achilles revealed a chest
protection under her cyclas and kissed his lover amid the
thickening combat. Sadly, Thersites brings rain on the parade
again. Coming up to Achilles, he began to berate him (though it
is not clear from the text what for), and then probably decided
to pique him in an extremely sophisticated way. He took a spear
and pierced an eye of the dead Penthesilea. Having recovered
from the shock, Achilles hit Thersites in the face so strongly
that it killed him on the spot, ingloriously ending the life of this
character who was thrown mud at by the author of the Trojan
cycles.

Let’s try to get an objective and common sense insight into
what happened.

First of all, Achilles belonged to heroes-demigods and
was vitally interested in the victory of Greeks over Troy. This
victory gave him rich trophies (including slaves) and surely
the expansion of his domain, saying nothing of the fame and
prestige. Second of all, before Achilles joined the battle (he
entered the battle when it was already on), the Amazons were
seriously pressing the Greeks; the latter began to retreat and
were almost pushed to their ships. They were so close to getting
on those boats. And Achilles knew very well where they would
have gone if they had boarded them. An extremely unpleasant

situation was created for the leaders... The smallest spark, like
the call of Thersites, was enough for the army to wave farewell
to their chiefs — like, you fight yourselves, and we are going
home. The precedent is fresh in the memory of Achilles. In
this situation, the aristocracy decided to stay one step ahead
of themselves and in the confusion of the battle Achilles kills
such an inconvenient fighter as Thersites since he can use
the situation any moment and get his own back for the recent
humiliation. However, an open murder of an equal to himself was
formally inexcusable even for Achilles (later he even had to sail
to Lesbos to clear himself from the abomination of the spilled
blood by bringing sacrifices to Apollo and Artemis). The author
of the myth-chronicle vitally needed to make a proper excuse to
the murder, the same as Achilles himself would probably make
among the aristocracy: lunatic Thersites was allegedly scoffing
at the dead body... While in reality Achilles just seized (maybe
even by prior arrangement with other aristocrats) the occasion
that was ideally suited for the elimination of the dangerous
rebel. I will not assert that this narrative is the only truth, but I
think it’s a viable option.

## CONCLUSION

All heroes-rebels from the Greek myths, mortals, and non-
mortals, have one thing in common: the all came to a sad end,
in layman’s terms. They were either forced to be in favour of
gods’ will and just because of this, they were forgiven or were
ruthlessly eliminated. None of them won this stand-off. And
this is rather consistent, and could not have been otherwise — in
a Greek myth (and, perhaps, in the conscience of ancient Greeks)

there wouldn’t be a place for such a character, he would fall
out of the frame of reference. Arachne wins in the contest with
Athena, and the latter leaves the ‘battlefield’ with her head low.
Otus and Ethialtes are entertained by Zeus’s wife... Naturally,
this is inconceivable for a Greek myth. This implies the most
important function of the Greek religion — the educational-
ideological role it plays. Myths were meant to demonstrate in
an instructive way: an argument with gods and their satraps
on earth (kings, aristocracy) is useless, fatal for the wrangler,
and the only result of it will be the flawless victory of a higher
person in the hierarchy. Thus, through subordination to divine
masters, people were put into the habit of subordinating to
worldly masters.

But looking behind the cover of edification and preaching we
will see the most important thing — what motivated Odysseus who
was beating Thersites, Zeus who was tormenting Prometheus,
Athena who forced Arachne to commit suicide. We will see
fear. Fear of gods, seemingly powerful and invincible before a
vast disempowered mass of the mortals, in the midst of which,
Bravehearts are born over and over again and openly challenge
the ‘eternal’ order. And it becomes clear: the mythology only
reflects the actual perpetual horror of the rulers in the face of
the slightest possibility of a popular uprising.

Yet, however, the Greek people were being scared by the
educational myths, they have inevitably made way to new
Thersites and Prometheuses. And I want to believe that at some
point they will overturn the Olympus.

***


He who conceits himself the master of heaven,\
Will be cast down to hell by his own children.\
Poseidon and Zeus treated like this\
Kronos who owned everything on earth.\
\
With no fear before Athena stood\
Arachne and called her out to a contest.\
A yester gladiator fought consuls\
A hundred years before the Crucifixion of Christ.\
\
Not everyone dares to challenge the authority,\
To loudly declare that the cold idol is dead,\
And though he never saw equality in life,\
To put an equals sign between the cloud-assembler and a slave.\
\
Though even now the hiss of lashes doesn’t cease,\
The heroes of the past, you are not forgotten!\
New Thersites proclaim on the Internet\
And a new Prometheus pours petrol into bottles…
