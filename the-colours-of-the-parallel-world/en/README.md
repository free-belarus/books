## [About the Book](./0.md)

“Colors of a Parallel World” is a collection of stories by the former Belarusian political prisoner Nikolai Dedka. The author was arrested in 2010 on charges of direct action in Minsk and spent five years in prison. The collection contains 16 stories and essays, written in captivity and after release, and narrating about the “multicolored” situations of prison reality — comic and terrifying, optimistic and gloomy.

Being a convinced anarchist, the author accompanies his observations with reflections on the political component of what he saw and an analysis of control mechanisms in the punitive system and society as a whole.
